# flask-swagger-boilerplate

Following is a boilerplate code for Flask API integrated with Swagger UI.
It also uses MarshMallow to structure the schemas and format responses.
Projects can be created on top of it.

## Folder Structure

api     -- stores all the main api files  
schemas -- stores the marshmallow schemas  
static  -- stores swagger config and other static files  
venv    -- stores the environment config

### What is Marshmallow? 
---
    marshmallow is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, 
    such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes.
    In short, marshmallow schemas can be used to:

    Validate input data.

    Deserialize input data to app-level objects.

    Serialize app-level objects to primitive Python types. 
    The serialized objects can then be rendered to standard formats 
    such as JSON for use in an HTTP API.
